Where the Clay model lives

The code lives here, and the managment of the code, roadmap, sprints, and other colab aspect are managed with Issues.


Note that this repo *is* public.

# Getting started

## Quickstart

Launch into a [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io) environment on

| [Binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest) | [Planetary Computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com) | [SageMaker Studio Lab](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws) |

## Installation

### Basic

To help out with development, start by cloning this [repo-url](/../../)

    git clone <repo-url>

Then we recommend [using mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
to install the dependencies.
A virtual environment will also be created with Python and
[JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) installed.

    cd model
    mamba env create --file environment.yml

Activate the virtual environment first.

    mamba activate claymodel

Finally, double-check that the libraries have been installed.

    mamba list

### Advanced

This is for those who want full reproducibility of the virtual environment.
Create a virtual environment with just Python and conda-lock installed first.

    mamba create --name claymodel python=3.11 conda-lock=2.4.2
    mamba activate claymodel

Generate a unified [`conda-lock.yml`](https://github.com/conda/conda-lock) file
based on the dependency specification in `environment.yml`. Use only when
creating a new `conda-lock.yml` file or refreshing an existing one.

    conda-lock lock --mamba --file environment.yml --platform linux-64 --with-cuda=11.8

Installing/Updating a virtual environment from a lockile. Use this to sync your
dependencies to the exact versions in the `conda-lock.yml` file.

    conda-lock install --mamba --name claymodel conda-lock.yml

See also https://conda.github.io/conda-lock/output/#unified-lockfile for more
usage details.

## Usage

### Running jupyter lab

    mamba activate claymodel
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name claymodel  # to install virtual env properly
    jupyter kernelspec list --json                       # see if kernel is installed
    jupyter lab &
